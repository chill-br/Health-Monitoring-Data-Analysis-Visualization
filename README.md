**Health Monitoring Data Analysis & Visualization**

"This repository features a dual-platform data analysis project on health monitoring, demonstrating end-to-end data processing and visualization. The project includes:

Python Analysis (Untitled6.ipynb): Jupyter Notebook showcasing data cleaning, feature engineering (e.g., creating age, blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation categories), and exploratory data analysis using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. This section covers the foundational statistical insights and initial visualizations of the healthmonitoring.csv dataset.
Power BI Dashboard: A companion Power BI file (not included in this repo but developed from the same data) that translates the Python-derived insights into an interactive dashboard, providing a user-friendly interface for stakeholders to explore distributions and trends across age groups, blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation.
This project underscores a strong capability in both programmatic data analysis and professional business intelligence reporting, offering a holistic view of health monitoring data."
